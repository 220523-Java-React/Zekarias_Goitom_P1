# Zekarias_Goitom_P1
For this project I built a Web API in java (via intellij), launched a Postgres database with the help of Docker (to keep that data persistent) and then used Postman to leverage that data (over the web) to perform Crud based, HTTP operations. 

Along with that, I used Gradle (as my automated build dependency manager) and leveraged these implementations: javalin, jackson, log4j, mockito, autho0 and postgresql

List of Technologies used include (but not limited to): Git, Git Hub, IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, Docker, Postman,  Java, DBeaver, Ubuntu, Postgres
