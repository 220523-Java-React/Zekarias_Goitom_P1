In this project we will build a Web API in the java language (via intellij), launch a Postgres database from a docker container to keep our data persisten. Finally we will use Postman to manipulate that data using Crud based, HTTP operations. 

Along with that, we will be using Gradle as our automated build dependency and leveraging several implementations including javalin, jackson, log4j, mockito, autho0 and postgresql

List of Technologies used: IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, Docker, Postman, Java, DBeaver, Ubuntu, Postgres
